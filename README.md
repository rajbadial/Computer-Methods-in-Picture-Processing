# Computational Methods in Picture Processing and Analysis
Labs and Final Project for the class CSI**** - Computational Methods in Picture Processing and Analysis (Omitted the class code to discourage future students from copying my solutions)

Final Project is a script that uses the users camera on their device and tracks their hand(s) and prints out the corresponding number they are holding up using image processing and analysis.
