topics - csi4133 - 10 Questions, few multiple choice, open-ended (writing and explanation, some are just asking why, calculations will be similar to what's seen in class)

03 and 04 are where I need practice / clarification

03 - Image Capture:

focal length, object distance, image distance

f-number (related to focal length)

aperture (opening size of the lens)

FOV

pin-hole camera model slide is good for understanding

knowing relations between these is important and can be asked calculation questions

1/f = 1/u + 1/v, where f is focal length, u is object distance, v is image distance
magnification = m = image_size / object_size = v / u, m = f / (u - f)

f = uv / (u+v)

pixel resolution - Image Capture - slide 25 for the question

depth of field - which factors affect it (aperture size, focal length, distance to subject)

optical distortions (barrel, pincushion, etc)

how focal length affects perspective

sampling and digitization

aliasing - undersampled image, moire pattern

04 - Color:

trichromatic coefficients, tristimulus

x = X / (X+Y+Z)
(x + y + z) = 1

conversion from XYZ to RGB

normalize RGB by 255 (say R = 120, R = 120/255 should be what's plotted in the multiplication)

To what RGB color 
corresponds the coordinate 
x=0.3, y=0.2?

To what x and y color 
corresponds to the R=40 
G=100 B=100?

05 - Image Enhancement:

histogram processing (*) - slide 17 review this

how to do histogram equalization - slide 22

given matrix of image / gray-level values, draw a histogram (# of occurrences of each level), or a table with each level in the first column, and # of occurrences in the next column, third column (called Sk) being its probability, and last one adding each probability (first one will be same as first probability, last one will be 100%), last column is rounding each Sk to its nearest integer. Probability of occurrence is # of occurrence / total # of pixels check around slide 38 for example

06 - Spatial Filtering - Smoothing:

linear filters (given matrices, which one is smoothing - the one with no negatives)
how do you apply these smoothing filters ?
convolution - ask gpt if needed to understand more
box filters, gaussian kernels

mean v median when applying filters, which one is replacing the center pixel

salt-and-pepper noise, why ?

07 - Spatial Filtering - Sharpening:

Laplacian - first and second derivatives

edge detection

canny edge detector - how does it works - parameters

Sigma, high and low thresholds - changing these does what, no computation all understanding

08 - Math Morphology:

structuring elements

adjacency matrices

erosion, dilation, duality of them

opening - smooths contour of an object
closing - see slides ~30

see how these structuring elements affect the images by opening and closing

Hit-or-Miss transform (HMT) - using two structuring elements
B1 should be within the image, B2 should be outside of it
slide 36

boundary extraction - boundary of image A is A - (A eroded by Structure Element B)

opening then closing can be used to eliminate 'salt and pepper' noise

hole filling
